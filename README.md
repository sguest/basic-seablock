# Simple Seablock

Start on an 1-tile island. Generate resources instead of mining them. Expand with landfill.

Heavily inspired by the original [Sea Block](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SeaBlock), but this is based on a primarily vanilla Factorio tech tree with minimal changes instead of the AngelBob suite.

**Important**: Choose the "Water World" map type for the true seablock experience

Changes from Vanilla tech tree

- New Electrolyzer building to generate sediment from water
- Refine sediment into store and ore
- Use [Bob's Greenhouse mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobgreenhouse) to generate wood
- Furnace recipe for wood to charcoal
- Cracking and coal liquefaction available as green-tier research
